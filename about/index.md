My name is Renato Gama, computer engineer from Brazil 
working mostly with software development using Node.js, MongoDb, MySql and Amazon Web Services, and spending a lot of my spare time doing projects with Arduino and Raspberry Pi.

This is a very simple blog intended to document my solutions to programming problems and any other experiences related to becoming a better engineer.
