My name is Renato Gama, a computer enginner from Brazil 
working mostly with software (Node.js, MongoDb, MySql and Amazon Web Services), but planning to work with 
Arduino in the near future.

This is a very simple blog intended mostly to document solutions to programming problems I have been having.
