title: Why windows as development environment sucks
---

1. Command prompt can't be resized to fill the whole monitor
2. Command prompt does not accept neither CTRL+V, CTRL+C or text selection direct.
3. Command prompt buffer is really small so you can't review (not so) old logging messages.
4. Very different commands from unix.
5. Command prompt has no tabs feature.
